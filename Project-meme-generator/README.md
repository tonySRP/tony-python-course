# Meme Generator Project
## Overview
For this Project you will use a prebuilt Meme class to generate some memes. Then you will edit the class to allow arguments. Finally you will extend the class to make genres of memes.

## Tasks

### 1. Generate memes
Use the built in Meme class to generate some memes. (keep it appropriate)

### 2. Edit Class
Edit the meme class to allow arguments. This means that instead of typing the values for the meme you should be able to pass them into the constructor.
```python
Meme("url","top","bottom","filename") #example
```
### 3. Extend Class
Make three classes that inherit from from the Meme class. (Check the inheritance examples to learn how to do this). One has to have the same picture every time and one has to have the same top text.
