# Card Game Project
## Overview
For this project you will have to make a Python program that allows you to play the card game War.

## Rules of War
In war each gets half the deck of cards. Each player draws a card from thier deck and plays it. Whoever played the bigger card gets both cards. If both players play the same cards they "declare war" and both place four cards facedown and one card face-up. Again, whoever's face-up card is bigger gets all ten cards.

## Criteria
1. You have to be able to choose to play a round by pressing a key (I will provide a keystroke detecting method)
2. When the game ends you have to be able to play another game
3. At the end of every round it should say what happened
